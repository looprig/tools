// editfile.go implements the EditFile tool: an exact-string-replace editor over a
// workspace-contained file (design §4b). It proves containment (containedPath,
// symlink-resolved) then reads and writes the LEXICAL joined path — the read is
// O_RDONLY|O_NOFOLLOW so a final-component symlink is REJECTED (consistent with
// ReadFile), and the atomic write targets the same lexical name so it REPLACES a
// final-component symlink rather than following it. It replaces `old` with
// `replacement` under strict occurrence rules, writes back atomically (the shared
// atomicWriteFile temp+Rename), and returns a diff preview. Like WriteFile it
// is a CallPreparer (direct filesystem.write requirement + typed artifact), is
// Auditable (no content), and is a WriteTarget.
//
// Occurrence rules (the §4b contract):
//   - 0 matches of `old`          → tool-result error ("not found")
//   - ≥2 matches && !replace_all  → tool-result error ("ambiguous: N matches…")
//   - exactly 1, or replace_all   → perform the replacement (all if replace_all)

// commitUncontained edits an UNCONTAINED (host) target WITHOUT ever touching the

// read/write must never authorize a later host edit, and vice versa (the same
// decision WithHostReads() enforces on the read side, and commitUncontained
// enforces on WriteFile's write side).
//
// EditFile's freshness mechanism differs from WriteFile's in a way that matters
// here: EditFile ALREADY reads the current file fresh at commit time
// (readForEdit), and the recorded observation hash is used ONLY as a comparator
// against that fresh read — never as the source of the bytes being edited. So for
// an uncontained target, this method simply SKIPS the
// obs.Observed/obs.Present/obs.Hash comparison; everything else (the fresh read,
// the exact-`old`-substring anchor match, the atomic write-back, the diff preview)
// stays IDENTICAL to the contained path. The anchor match in applyReplacement is
// itself real freshness protection, but its strength depends on replace_all:
//   - replace_all=false: it degrades gracefully. applyReplacement requires
//     EXACTLY ONE occurrence of `old`, so if the file changed underneath since
//     the model last saw it in a way that alters the occurrence count (zero, or
//     two-or-more), the edit refuses loudly with a distinct editAnchorError —
//     never a silent wrong-edit.
//   - replace_all=true: the check is weaker. applyReplacement only requires AT
//     LEAST ONE occurrence and then replaces ALL of them, so it confirms `old`
//     still exists somewhere, not that the occurrence SET is unchanged. If the
//     file drifts between the model's read and this commit such that a NEW
//     occurrence of `old` appears somewhere the model never saw, that occurrence
//     is silently replaced too — a contained target does not have this gap,
//     because its CAS check requires a fresh full-file read matching the exact
//     current on-disk hash before any edit is authorized, so ANY drift (not just
//     a changed occurrence count) is caught before applyReplacement ever runs.
//     This is an accepted, intentional residual risk of skipping the CAS check
//     for host targets (see TestEditFileHostWritesReplaceAllOverReplacesDriftedOccurrences),
//     not an oversight.
//
// This is why no NEW freshness mechanism is needed for the non-replace_all
// uncontained case — the anchor match already does freshness-adjacent work, and
// the CAS check on top of it was specifically about not editing based on a stale
// cached hash the model never actually re-verified, which does not apply once
// host edits get no cached authority at all.
//
// Unlike WriteFile, EditFile never creates a file (an absent target is already an
// honest "file not found" — there is nothing to edit), so no parent-directory
// pre-flight check is needed here.
//
// Like WriteFile's commitUncontained, bypassing e.obs.WithPath here also bypasses
// its internal per-canonical-path lock: cross-loop serialization for the SAME
// real file still happens one layer up via the coordinator's PathMutation permit
// (InvokableRun acquires it before commit is ever called) so long as a
// coordinator is bound, but a coordinator-free EditFile gives an uncontained
// target NO same-loop serialization at all — unlike a contained target, which
// still serializes on the WithPath lock even coordinator-free. See WriteFile's
