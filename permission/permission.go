// parallel tool batch (MaxParallelToolCalls, default 8), where up to that many
// Check calls can be in flight at once. It is accepted because the atomicity it
// buys (a Check never observes a half-applied concurrent session grant, and the
// two-file deny-beats-allow reduction is computed against a single consistent
// policy snapshot) outweighs the cost: the approvals files are small and the
// hashcache returns memoized parses for unchanged content, so the held I/O is a
// cheap, cache-fast read in the common case, and this is an interactive agent,
// not a high-QPS service. If lock contention ever does matter, the noted future
// option is a lock-free snapshot refactor — snapshot the policy fields under the
// lock, release it, then do the file I/O + matching outside the lock — exactly
// as DeniedRead already does for its read-filter check. Until then the locking
// stays as-is; the security core (the decision + the single-mutex structure) is
