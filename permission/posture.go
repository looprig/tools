// posture.go implements the posture-driven auto-approve stage (Stage 6.5) and the
// guarantee interlock (SPEC §10.2/§10.3) — the LOAD-BEARING safety gate that lets
// a security mode auto-approve file edits and Bash, but ONLY when the injected OS
// sandbox actually enforces the guarantees the posture requires.
//
// harness stays MODE-AGNOSTIC: it never sees a mode name, only a Posture (what a
// mode implies for the gate) and, for dynamic mode, a stdlib ORDINAL security limit (§8).
// harness NEVER imports github.com/looprig/sandbox: the runner is held as a
// stdlib-typed tool.CommandRunner and probed STRUCTURALLY for its optional
// GuaranteeBits()/Level() capabilities via type assertion.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED INVARIANT (same family as EffectAsk == 0): no runner, a runner
// without GuaranteeBits, a missing required bit, a Level below the floor, an
// out-of-range security limit ordinal, or a grant-carrying call all resolve to the SAFE
// direction — the stage declines to auto-approve and the call falls to Stage 7
// (Ask). The stage can ONLY ever auto-approve or decline; it never denies and can
// never override the non-bypassable Stage 1/2 (containment + hard-deny) denies,
// the Stage 3 EffectChecker veto, or a Stage 5/6 persisted/session deny — those
// all run FIRST (Check calls this stage last, just before the default Ask).

// Posture expresses what a security mode implies for the permission gate. It is
// built by the CONSUMER (which knows the mode names) and handed to harness, which
// treats it opaquely. The zero Posture auto-approves nothing (fail-closed default,
// used as the most-restrictive table[0] and when no posture is configured).

	// AutoApproveEdits auto-approves file-edit/write tools (WriteFile/EditFile) — but,
	// like Bash, ONLY when the guarantee interlock passes: the held runner must enforce
	// RequiredGuaranteesEdits (and any RequiredLevel floor). Edits are ALSO confined by
	// the non-bypassable write-containment + hard-deny stages and the in-process
	// ReadGuard, but in-process containment alone is not an OS write-boundary — so on a
	// non-enforcing backend (nil / null-backend runner) the interlock fails and edits
	// degrade to Ask, uniform with Bash. A zero RequiredGuaranteesEdits requires nothing
	// (no interlock — the backward-compatible / unconfined choice).

	// network boundary a Bash auto-approve requires). The interlock passes only when
	// runnerBits & RequiredGuaranteesEdits == RequiredGuaranteesEdits. A zero mask
	// requires nothing — an AutoApproveEdits posture with a zero mask auto-approves edits
