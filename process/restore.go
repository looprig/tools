// RestoreError reports one persisted process resource that Restore could not

// than aborting its whole scan, so one corrupt entry never hides every other
// healthy one (spec combined-acceptance: "corrupt entries are isolated and

// Restore is the session-restore entrypoint (spec "Manifests and
// durability": "On normal session restore ..."). It scans every manifest
// durably persisted beneath the Supervisor's ManifestStore root and
// reconciles each one into a queryable, non-running s.entries record:
//
//   - a manifest already in a terminal State (state.go's State.Terminal())
//     is reopened as-is: its completed output remains readable through its
//     Spool, with no live tool.Process, goroutine, lease, or quota
//     reservation (TestRestoreCompletedOutput);
//   - a manifest still in StateStarting or StateRunning means the supervisor
//     process that was running it no longer exists -- a session restore
//     implies exactly that (spec: "a manifest marked running or starting
//     becomes lost_on_restore"). It is durably transitioned to the terminal
//     StateLostOnRestore first (markLostOnRestore), publishing the lost
//     lifecycle event and completion notification through the manifest's
//     already-persisted stable LifecycleEventIDs.Lost/CommandID -- never a
//     freshly minted ID (TestRestoreRunningBecomesLost,
//     TestRestorePublicationCrashRetriesStableID) -- and only then reopened
//     the same way as an already-terminal manifest.
//
// Restore is intended to be called once, immediately after NewSupervisor and
// before any Start/Wait call, as the caller's session-restore step; it is not
// a periodic reconciliation loop, and it never touches quota bookkeeping
// (runningByLoop/runningBySession/reservedMemoryBytes/reservedSpoolBytes):
// nothing here was ever actually reserved by this process instance, and
// nothing will ever call releaseQuota for a restored entry.
//
// Restore never constructs, obtains, or references a tool.Process,
// tool.PreparedProcess, or tool.AsyncProcessRunner: there is no live process
// handle for a restored entry, by construction, so there is no signal-capable
// value anywhere in this reconciliation path that could ever be handed a
// persisted PID (spec: "Restore never signals a PID recovered from persisted
// metadata"; TestRestoreNeverSignalsPersistedPID). The manifest's unexported
// osMetadata field is never read here at all -- see manifest.go's osMetadata
// doc comment.
//
// A manifest that fails to load, or whose disk spool fails to reopen, does
// not abort the scan: it is recorded in the returned RestoreReport.Errors and
// every other manifest is still reconciled normally.
