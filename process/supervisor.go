//
// Shutdown closes admission (closeAdmission) as its very first step --
// before requesting termination of a single process -- so a concurrent Start
// call is rejected immediately with CodeSupervisorShuttingDown even while
// Shutdown's later termination/escalation steps are still in flight
// (TestShutdownClosesAdmissionBeforeStop).
//
// Every currently running entry (snapshotRunningEntries) is signaled
// tool.ProcessSignalTerminate concurrently, one goroutine per entry; an
// entry that has not confirmed exit within cfg.GracefulShutdownPeriod of
// that request is then signaled tool.ProcessSignalKill
// (TestShutdownEscalatesAndConfirmsTrees). Shutdown waits on each entry's
// exited channel -- not done -- for that confirmation: see entry.go's
// exited field doc comment for why a slow or backpressured completion
// notification must never delay this step (combined-acceptance:
// "notification backpressure cannot block terminalization"). A signaled
// entry's actual terminal-state computation and manifest write are never
// bypassed or duplicated here -- run's existing natural Wait()-return path
// (entry.terminalize) is what every signal ultimately drives, exactly as it
// already does for an unforced exit.
//
// Shutdown is idempotent and safe to call concurrently: only the first
// call's invocation actually runs the shutdown sequence (sync.Once); every
// concurrent or later caller receives that exact same result
// (TestShutdownConcurrentCallersShareResult). Only the first caller's ctx is
// ever used -- every other caller's ctx argument is ignored, exactly like
// every other input to a no-op Do call.
//
// A teardown failure -- a Signal call that itself returns an error --
// doesn't stop the affected entry from reaching a terminal state: its run
// goroutine still classifies whatever outcome its live tool.Process.Wait
// ultimately reports and terminalizes normally. Shutdown only aggregates
// every such Signal failure into its own returned error, a *Error wrapping
// CodeTeardownFailed (TestShutdownTeardownFailureRetainsAuthority) --

// Wait is already released once an entry's done channel closes (Task 9A's
// existing generation/done wake mechanism), no new mechanism required.
// Closing storage handles is a deliberate no-op: neither ManifestStore nor
// Spool has (or should have) a Supervisor-wide Close of its own -- a

// Start begins supervising one already-prepared process. The caller has
// already resolved an AsyncProcessRunner, called PrepareProcess, and
// acquired the matching workspace lease (spec "Workspace coordination");
// Start only ever consumes what it is handed -- it never calls
// PrepareProcess itself. owner and origin are recorded verbatim as the new
// process's Identity (identity.go); prepared is the single-use preparation
// this call consumes; lease is released on every path that does not end
// with a registered entry owning it; sink, observations, ceiling, and yield
// are recorded on the entry for later microtasks to use.
//
// Start reserves every quota reserveQuota enforces before calling
// prepared.Start (TestSupervisorReservesQuotaBeforeStart), at most once,
// exactly matching PreparedProcess.Start's own single-use contract. It then
// atomically persists this process's manifest in state StateStarting --
// via s.manifests, a real durable ManifestStore -- before ever calling
// prepared.Start, so a Handle can never be returned for a process that has
// no durable record (TestSupervisorPersistsBeforeReturningHandle; spec
// "Manifests and durability": "Before returning a process handle, Tools
// atomically persists a manifest"). This requires minting the Handle (and
// therefore checking handleExists) before prepared.Start is called, not
// after, unlike a Handle-agnostic admission flow would.
//
// If prepared.Start fails, Start releases every reservation it made,
// releases lease, closes prepared -- idempotent per the Harness
// PreparedProcess contract -- and transitions the already-persisted
// StateStarting manifest directly to StateFailed (there is no live entry
// on this path, so this is a plain synchronous Save, not
// entry.terminalize's compare-and-set: Start's own call sequence is
// already the only writer of this manifest at this point, and no
// concurrent caller can race it) before returning a *Error wrapping
// CodeSpawnFailed (TestSupervisorStartFailureReleasesQuota). If a quota is
// already exhausted, Start returns a *Error wrapping
// CodeProcessQuotaExceeded without ever calling prepared.Start or
// prepared.Close, and without minting a Handle or writing any manifest
// (TestSupervisorRejectsSessionAndLoopQuota).
//
// Once prepared.Start succeeds, Start persists the manifest's StateRunning
// transition, opens this process's in-memory Buffer and durable Spool
// (both sized from the exact quota reservation -- see reservation's doc
// comment), registers the entry, and starts the entry's single
// wait/activity/drain goroutine (entry.go's run) on a lifetime-scoped
// context that is deliberately independent of ctx (see run's doc comment
// for why). Start returns the freshly minted Handle only after the entry
// is registered and its goroutine has been started
// (TestSupervisorDrainsOrderedStreams, TestSupervisorSpoolCeilingDropsOldest).
//
// Start allocates this process's stable LifecycleEventIDs
// (newLifecycleEventIDs) and records them on the very first manifest it
// persists, so they are already durably in place before the process can
// ever reach a terminal state (TestSupervisorPublishesStableLifecycleIDs;
// spec "Manifests and durability"). Start itself does not arbitrate a
// terminal state for a process that reaches one after prepared.Start
// succeeds -- that is entry.terminalize's one-shot compare-and-set
// (entry.go), driven by run's natural Wait() return today and, starting in
// Task 9C, also by an explicit stop request, a deadline timeout, or
// supervisor shutdown.
//
// If closeAdmission has already been called, Start rejects admission
// immediately with a *Error wrapping CodeSupervisorShuttingDown, before
// reserving any quota or touching prepared at all
// (TestSupervisorShutdownRejectsAdmission).
